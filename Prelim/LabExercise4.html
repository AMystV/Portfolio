    <p><a href="https://www.respawn.com/"; target="_blank">Respawn</a> is still a relatively new studio, but its legacy can be found in the 
        modern first person shooter in all its forms - from <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/medal-of-honor"; target="_blank">Medal of Honor</a>
        to <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/modernwarfare"; target="_blank">Modern Warfare</a> and then,
        finally, to Titanfall. There's a through line there that's clear to see when 
        you embark on <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/titanfall/titanfall-2"; target="_blank">Titanfall 2's</a> 
        brief but sumptuous campaign. The heritage of a studio that effectively created 
        the cinematic shooter, 
        that married that with spectacle and storytelling in Modern Warfare, and now 
        has been afforded the opportunity to build an FPS campaign around the rarest 
        of things in this genre - ideas.</p>

    <p> For five or so hours, Respawn assaults you with concepts, with gameplay systems
         and with strokes of design ingenuity, never relenting until you hit the end 
         credits. And then it's done. A close friend of mine, having finished the 
         single-player, described it as a mic-drop (a line so good I was furious I 
         hadn't thought of it myself) - it's Respawn's statement on what it is capable 
         of as a studio, and just how far the first-person shooter campaign has been 
         going in recent years.</p>

    <p> Most of the time, Titanfall 2 feels like a set of mechanics in search of a game. 
        To be fair, occasionally it finds one. There's a few points in the game — such 
        as a level demanding platforming through a series of rotating landscapes being
        "assembled" for a maniacal robot's combat trials, or navigating through the 
        bowels of a communications facility that wasn't designed for human interaction 
        — where it finds its footing, no pun intended. It might be surprising to hear 
        that Titanfall 2 is the most fun when you're doing the least shooting — when Respawn 
        lets it feel more more like, say <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TluRVBhmf8w"; target="_blank">Portal</a>
        , it's considerably more fun.</p>

        <h2><u>Campaign</u></h2>

        <p>The single player campaign alone is good enough to justify the purchase price---
        though it's important to note that I'm the sort of gamer who prefers shorter, 
        high-quality campaigns over sprawling open world slogs filled with busy work.
        Every mission has some twist and some clever design element that keeps the entire 
        campaign diverse and fresh. Much of it is so good that I'm tempted to jump right
        back in and play it all again---and I'll do just that once the madness of the 
        holiday season slows down and I have the time.</p>

        <p>The characters are largely generic. Jack Cooper, the protagonist, even sounds generic.
        But his relationship with the Titan, BT 7274, is actually pretty moving. Their many 
        humorous interactions are a nice touch as well. As for villains, you get boss fights, 
        all of which play out as mech battles, but the actual bad guys remain pretty 
        two-dimensional. It's not a bad story by any means, but I hope that the next game gives 
        us more to latch onto.</p>
    
        <h2><p><b><u>Multiplayer</u></b></p></p></h2>

        <p><u><b>Bounty Hunt:</b></u> You're rewarded for killing the enemy Pilots and AI, and then have to 
        deposit your reward funds into a bank at the end of each wave. You can steal some 
        of the money if you kill an enemy Pilot.</p>

        <p><b><u>Amped Hardpoint:</u></b> Teams battle to control points. If you control the point and then 
        "amp" it up, you get even more points.</p>

        <p><u><b>Pilots vs. Pilots:</b></u> Just like it reads. You fight without Titans getting in the way.</p>

        <p><u><b>Capture the Flag:</b></u> Get the flag. Run with it. You've played this before.</p>

        <p><u><b>Free For All:</b></u> Shoot everybody. Nobody is your friend.</p>

        <p><u><b>Last Titan Standing:</b></u> Titans only, no Pilots allowed.</p>

        <p><u><b>Skirmish:</b></u> Basically Attrition with a lower score limit and no AI enemies. Still lots of fun,
        but just your basic Team Deathmatch (with mecha.)</p>

        <p>I recommend playing the solo campaign before you move on to the multiplayer, as it serves as
             a great tutorial for PvP. You go through all <b>SIX Titans</b> in the campaign and get to try out 
             a bunch of cool abilities. These Titans are:</p>
    
        <p><u><b>Ion:</b></u> The starting Titan class, but still a really great mech with fun powers. It's kind of 
            the "every-man" or "every-Titan" with a good balanced loadout that includes rockets and a 
            really stellar Laser Core ultimate ability.</p>
        
        <p><u><b>Scorch:</b></u> As the name implies, this one is all about fire. You can slam the ground and send a
             wave of liquid fire across the ground. The ultimate is a huge inferno.</p>

        <p><u><b>Tone:</b></u> Tracking missiles, a strong canon, and the wonderful Missile Core ultimate make Tone 
            a really fun Titan to play. Missile Core is one of my favorite ultimates, though Northstar's 
            version is better.</p>
            
        <p><u><b>Ronin:</b></u> A lighter, faster mech with a shotgun and a teleport ability, Ronin is a blast to play. 
            This is the one with the Sword Core ability, giving you some crazy close-up lethality.</p>
            
        <p><u><b>Northstar:</b></u> Instead of Missile Core, Northstar has Flight Core. This is the one "flying" mech 
            though it really just hovers above the ground. Think Pharah if you're an 
            <b><u><a href="https://overwatch.blizzard.com/"; target="_blank">Overwatch</a></u></b> player.</p>
            
        <p><u><b>Legion:</b></u> The last mech you get in the game is also super powerful. The chaingun is powerful, but
             the Smart Core ultimate makes it doubly so, since it targets enemies without having to 
             aim (think Soldier 76 if you play Overwatch, but huge and can target way more stuff at once.)</p>

            <p><h2><u>Graphics And Gameplay</u></h2></p> 

            <p> is what you'd expect for the most part. It builds off the previous game. You wall-run, slide and double-jump, 
             and the more you do these things the faster you'll go. Grappling hooks in multiplayer simply extend your reach. In the 
             campaign, you'll do a surprising amount of this stuff as well, as each level is designed around these core mechanics. 
             Shooting feels a great deal like Call of Duty, unsurprisingly, though Respawn has done a great job creating really unique 
             weapons. The arsenal is almost all fun to play, but certain weapons like the EVA-8 auto-shotgun are a blast.</p>
             
            <p>Lots of little things make the game just feel good. Even just hopping into or out of your Titan is such a breeze. 
                It just clicks nicely, in the same way a game like <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2370518/"; target="_blank"><u><b>Metal Gear Solid V</b></u></a> 
                had very tight controls that simply felt good to use.</p>
             
             <p>Titanfall 2 looks outstanding on both PS4 and PC, the two platforms I've played it on. I hear it looks 
                very good on Xbox One as well, but haven't had the chance to try it out myself. Not only do the graphics look 
                good, but in both single and multiplayer there's tons of level and map variety. You'll find yourself in all 
                kinds of different environments, and they all look incredible. The campaign in particular has many jaw-dropping 
                moments of raw beauty, but even the multiplayer is a looker.</p>
